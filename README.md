# Connect4
- This is the second Milestone Project of the Python Bootcamp on Udemy taught by Jose Portilla. 
- Though the original task was to create a BlackJack game, I created a Connect4 game instead to demonstrate my OOP skills in a format with which I wa more familiar 
- It is a simple Connect4 game with rudimentary graphics in the form of console output, being played against a computer or against another person. 
- It accepts players and their names, randomizes the starting order to give a fair chance to both competitors and it updates and prints the board based on validated user input. 
- The game provides the user with messages in the event of wins or ties and allows for the option to play again. 

### Motivation
- Milestone Project 2: Complete 2020 Python Bootcamp by Jose Portilla

## Getting Started
- To be able to play this game, run the connect4.py script on an IDE - I used the Pycharm IDE by JetBrains
- Alternatively, this game can be played on a command line terminal as well - I played it on the Windows Command Prompt
> Call the following while in the directory of the program: `python connect4.py`

## Installation
- Import the shuffle and randint functions from the random library for the player order swap to work and for the computer generated selections to work

### Authors
- This game was developed by myself, [Ali Raza Zaidi](https://twitter.com/Ali_RZ02)

### Learning Process
- Although my expertise in Java allowed me to transition quite easily to programming in Python, there were several new things I learned while creating this game
- I learned Python-specific syntax like the def function, import function in Python, for loops in Python mong many others
- I became more familiar with dynamically-typed languages
- I became more familiar with OOP principles and their uses in Python
- I became familiar with debugging and error handling along with their uses in external libraries such as pylint
- I learned about special methods such as the __init__ method

### Acknowledgements
- Most of my learning came from the Udemy course on Python by [Jose Portilla](https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp)
- Thanks to [RealPython](https://realpython.com/python-range/) for their resource on using the range function decrement through a loop in Python
